	<p>Kate Wagner starts out the article with a memory of their first internet experience when they were just five years old serves as an important reminder of how much the digital environment has changed over time. It's fascinating to reflect on the beginnings of the internet, when it was still largely unexplored territory and one could find GeoCities pages devoted to the most specialized subjects. Her journey through various internet culture eras is a reflection of broader societal changes that have taken place in this period. The divisions of the internet into three distinct periods by Geert Lovink offer a helpful outline for comprehending this evolution, "precommercial, text&#150;only period before the World Wide Web. Second, the euphoric, speculative period in which the Internet opened up for the general audience, culminating in the late 1990s dotcom mania. Third, the post&#150;dot&#150;com crash/post&#150;9/11 period, which is now coming to a close with the Web 2.0 mini&#150;bubble". Wagner states "These GIFs come from Giphy, which has been integrated with Instagram for years. They’re lo&#150;res, imperfect, and entirely decontextualized. These disembodied ghosts&#151;ancient in computer years&#151;blink back at me because tech companies know that, based on my age, I like them. And I do like them. I miss where they came from&#151;it’s a place I’ve found is no longer there" This quote Wagner expresses a way she connects the past and present and the use of Instagram as a platform for sharing their internet nostalgia. Many people other than Wagner express nostalgia for the internet before social media. Those early years, when the online world seemed like a wild, uncharted frontier, had a certain allure. However, the author wisely notes that nostalgia for this time period itself has turned into a commodity in today's world. In the article it states "the phenomenon of the self&#150;eating internet may not be obvious when we think about it in the abstract; we need to break it down into its constituent operations” where Wagner introduces the idea of "self eating internet. It's interesting to consider the idea of the "self-eating internet" as a form of technological cannibalism. It emphasizes the notion that the distinctive and memorable aspects of the early internet are gradually being replaced by the newer, more commercialized versions of the online world.</p>
	 <p> I, too, grew up in the revolutionary decade of the 2000s, when technology and the internet advanced quickly and assimilated into our daily lives, I identify strongly with the author's account. My own experiences during this time period are similar in the author's journey through the various phases of internet culture, from the beginnings of Geocities to ‌social media behemoths like Facebook and Instagram. The extreme difference between our childhoods and the upbringing of my younger siblings, who were born into a world where technology and the internet were already firmly entrenched, is one of the most striking features of this shared experience. Wagner had a really pessimistic view on the status quo internet. In my eyes innovation of technology and the internet is really interesting and I respect it. Instead of dwelling solely on the bygone era of the internet, she can explore how it has shaped the digital world we live in today. Engaging in meaningful conversations about the evolving internet culture with peers who share her sentiments can provide a sense of connection and understanding. She might consider striking a balance between the old and the new, finding ways to integrate the simplicity and authenticity of the early internet into her current online experiences. Ultimately, finding remedies for nostalgia involves cherishing the past while staying open to the innovations and opportunities that the ever-evolving digital landscape has to offer. This article depicts a analysis of their own experience using the internet throughout time serves as a microcosm of the more significant changes in internet culture. It serves as a reminder that, as digital natives, we are actively contributing to the internet's progress rather than just being its passive users. Our online experiences are still being shaped by the interplay between nostalgia and the constant march of innovation in the digital sphere.</p>
